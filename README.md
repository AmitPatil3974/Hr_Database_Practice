Project Overview

This project focuses on practicing SQL concepts using a comprehensive HR dataset. It covers essential SQL techniques and operations necessary for working with real-world databases in business and data analytics contexts. The dataset includes information on employees, departments, salaries, job roles, and more, providing a robust foundation for learning and mastering SQL.

Key Concepts and Techniques Covered

1. Selecting Data

Basic SELECT statements to retrieve data from tables.

Using DISTINCT to remove duplicate records.

2. Restricting and Sorting Data

WHERE clause to filter records based on conditions.

ORDER BY clause to sort data in ascending or descending order.

BETWEEN, IN, and LIKE operators for advanced filtering.

3. Aggregate Functions and Group By

COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX to perform calculations on data.

GROUP BY to group rows sharing a property and apply aggregate functions.

HAVING clause to filter grouped data.

4. Subqueries

Single-row and multi-row subqueries.

Correlated subqueries for complex nested queries.

5. Joins

INNER JOIN to combine rows from two or more tables based on related columns.

LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL OUTER JOIN for different join conditions.

Self-joins to compare rows within the same table.

6. Date and Time Functions

DATE, DATETIME, and TIME manipulation.

Functions like NOW(), CURDATE(), DATEADD(), DATEDIFF() to manage temporal data.

7. String Functions

Concatenation and substring functions like CONCAT(), SUBSTRING().

Length calculation and case conversion using LENGTH(), UPPER(), LOWER().

Trimming and padding strings with TRIM(), LPAD(), RPAD().
